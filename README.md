How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on realizing a colorful and easy-to-navigate user interface, using color contrast to diffentiate containers and sections. 

Optimizations

To improve this project, I want to update the choice of colors and work on a responsive design to make it accessible from all devices.

Lessons Learned:

Navigation is the crucial point when looking for something specific.
